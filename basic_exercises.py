# Write a loop that loop over the keys in a dictionary and prints the values

# Write the functions is_odd and is_even that are shown in the lecture

# Loop over my_first_list and square the value if the value is a number, 
# and print the calories of the fruit if itâ€™s a fruit (hint: use the dictionary to look up the calories)

# write a function that takes a dictionary as an argument, loops over the keys in the dictionary, prints the square of the value in the value
